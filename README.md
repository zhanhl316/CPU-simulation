# CPU-simulation

The goal of this assignment is to develop a CPU scheduling algorithm that will complete the execution of a group of multi-threaded processes in an OS that understands threads (kernel threads). Since a real implementation of your scheduling algorithm is not feasible, you will implement a simulation of your CPU scheduling algorithm. Each process will have 1-50 threads; each of the threads has its own CPU and I/O requirements. The simulated scheduling policy is on the thread level.
